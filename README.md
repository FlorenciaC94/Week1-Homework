# Horiseon Webpage Accessibility 


# Description

In this project I had to refactor Horiseon's current web page to meet accessibility standards by changing the code to semantic HTML, adding "alt" attributes to images and cleaning up the CSS style sheet. By adding commments to the CSS file, I help my reader understand where these styling properties apply to the HTML file.I also fixed issues including: broken links in the page's navgation bar, added a descriptve title to the page, and fixed the heading attributes so they fall in subsequential order.
